## Build a Blockchain from Scratch in Go

### Overview

This project is a study and implementation of a blockchain from scratch, using the book *Build a Blockchain from Scratch in Go* by Lukas Lukac as a guide. The goal is to understand the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology, such as distributed ledgers, cryptographic hashing, consensus algorithms, and peer-to-peer networking, and to implement these concepts in Go (Golang).

### Features

- **Basic Blockchain Structure**: Implements the core blockchain data structure, including blocks, transactions, and the chain itself.
- **Proof of Work (PoW) Algorithm**: A basic consensus algorithm to achieve agreement among decentralized nodes.
- **Networking**: Peer-to-peer communication for block propagation and synchronization.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: A simple CLI to interact with the blockchain, mine blocks, and perform transactions.


### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the core principles behind blockchain technology.
2. Gain hands-on experience in building a blockchain from scratch.
3. Learn to implement various blockchain components in Go, including consensus mechanisms, cryptographic operations, and network communication.
